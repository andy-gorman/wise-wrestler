# Wise Wrestler
This is the code for my twitter bot, Wise Wrestlers. This bot tweets a random picture of a random wrestler with a inspiring quote falsely attributed to them.

You need a Twitter App access token, consumer key, and associated secrets. You will also need a Bing Search API key. You should put these in the config.js file.
